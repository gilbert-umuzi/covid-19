# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an analysis of COVID-19 trends and mortality factors across different counties. By integrating and analyzing data from Data Commons, the project identifies patterns in COVID-19 case trends, explores potential correlations with contextual features, and employs machine learning techniques to predict outcomes.

## Features
* Data Integration: Merges various datasets to form a comprehensive view of COVID-19 impacts.
* Trend Analysis: Utilizes normalization and clustering to identify and analyze case trends across counties.
* Geographic Distribution: Examines the spatial distribution of COVID-19 clusters to understand regional variations.
* Mortality Factor Analysis: Explores correlations between COVID-19 mortality rates and contextual features through data cleaning, ratio calculations, and pairwise correlation analysis.
* Predictive Modeling: Applies Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and logistic regression to forecast COVID-19 outcomes based on identified trends and factors.
